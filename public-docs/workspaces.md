# Workspaces

Paseo is organized around workspaces, not chats.

A workspace is the place where a task happens. It has a working directory and can contain multiple sessions running at the same time. In the app, each session opens as a tab.

## Projects contain workspaces

The sidebar starts with projects. A project can be a git repository, a GitHub project, or any directory on a machine running the Paseo daemon.

Inside each project are workspaces. For example:

```
my-app
├── main
├── fix-login-flow
└── redesign-settings
```

Each workspace is a separate place to work. You can keep one for your main checkout, create another for a feature, or open a GitHub PR as another workspace.

## Workspaces contain sessions

Agents run inside a workspace as sessions. A workspace can have one agent session, several agent sessions, terminals, browsers, and diffs open at the same time.

That matters because real development rarely fits into one long chat. You might ask one agent to implement a feature, open a terminal to run a service, start another agent to review the diff, and keep the browser open next to both. Those belong together because they are all part of the same task.

In Paseo, the workspace is the stable container. The sessions are what you run inside it.

## Creating a workspace

When you create a new workspace, Paseo creates a working directory for it. If you are using git, this is an isolated git worktree on its own branch, so agents can work in parallel without touching your main checkout. Paseo names the branch from your first prompt.

You can also create a workspace without starting an agent right away. The workspace is still there with its working directory ready; you can open terminals, run services, or browse files, then start an agent later.

Either way, once the workspace exists you can add more sessions to it. Open a terminal alongside an agent, start a second agent to review changes, or open a browser tab to check a local service. Every session lives as a tab inside the same workspace.

## Worktrees

Every workspace in Paseo is backed by a working directory. When that directory is a git worktree, you get a separate branch and isolated environment for each task.

If you want the details on configuring setup hooks, scripts, and services, continue to [Git worktrees](/docs/worktrees).
